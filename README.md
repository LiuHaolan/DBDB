developed by Python3.0 that implements a simple key/value database, aims to preserve data in the face of  computer crashes and error conditions.

# Future Work
I want to develop a relational database that is clear in concepts, evolve by interfaces to teach concepts in database.
How? By providing APIs for user, they can code iteratively and finish the whole system.
For example, first providing a SQL parser and let them to make an simple backend in an indirection layer.
